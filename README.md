publiclearning – The AI Frontier Lab
Project Overview
publiclearning is my living lab, a public logbook of experiments, failures, wins, and insane ideas — all centered around applying AI where it's never been applied before. This isn’t just learning in public — this is building the impossible in public.

Inspired by Star Trek’s Prime Directive, I’m on a mission to boldly apply artificial intelligence to domains untouched, systems unoptimized, and questions unanswered.

This is where theory meets the edge of execution.

What You’ll Find Here
Raw experiments using AI in unknown, low-tech, or human-first areas

Thought logs, research notes, and step-by-step breakdowns

New AI use cases being prototyped (education, emotion-mapping, philosophy, life-systems, micro-civilization models)

Open-source code, agents, prompts, and conceptual diagrams

Mind maps and breakdowns using first-principles thinking

Mission Statement
"This repo is not just a place to learn — it's a place to rewrite the rules.
To apply AI like a technomancer in areas no one dared — until now."
— Captain Chaos | Future Architect
